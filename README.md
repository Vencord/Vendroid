# Vendroid

Vendroid is not actively being improved. However, it still functions just fine and doesn't need any updates (it is not abandoned / discontinued).

For a more feature complete app, check out VendroidEnhanced instead!

Vendroid is a custom Discord client for Android. The way it works is that it loads the discord.com website and injects Vencord.

Discord's mobile site is not very usable since it has many issues. As such, this is mostly just a proof of concept and is not actively worked on.

You are likely better off using other mods that specifically target the Android app, like [Aliucord](https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord).
